// Implements task 9 in TODO-synced-share-rust-d1-migration.md: errors here
// are meant to be maximally verbose (per §0) EXCEPT for one hard exception --
// the GitHub OAuth token and its stored hash must never appear. The worker's
// `unauthorized` `ApiError` (a `VerificationFailure`, `crates/live-share-worker/src/verification.rs`)
// has no field for either by construction, so the common case is already
// safe by the time it reaches here; `redactSecrets` below is a defensive
// backstop for any other failure shape (a raw non-2xx body, a thrown network
// error) that might somehow echo one back.
