Feature: Lyrics under a chord part
  A lyrics part can target a chords part (`l = lyrics[c]`). The lyric line
  carries its own timing: each bracketed item pairs with a chord attack (at most one per attack),
  and unbracketed syllables flow freely between them (see "Lyrics under a
  chord part" in syntax.md).

  # These scenarios fail until the feature is implemented (tasks 3-6 of
  # HANDOFF-chord-lyrics.md).

  Scenario: Brackets pair with chord attacks and the chord sits above its bracket
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 -- 7" and lyrics "(~) 只剩下鋼琴 （陪）我"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has no error
    And the chord-lyrics preview shows "(~)"
    And the chord-lyrics preview shows "(陪)"
    And the chord "7" is drawn above the bracket "(陪)"

  Scenario: Full-width brackets are drawn as ASCII brackets
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 -- 7" and lyrics "(~) 只剩下鋼琴 （陪）我"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics preview shows "(陪)"
    And the chord-lyrics preview does not show "（"
    And the chord-lyrics preview does not show "）"

  Scenario: A pickup run before the first bracket is allowed when the first chord attack is not on beat 1
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "0 1 - -" and lyrics "我 (愛) 你"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has no error

  Scenario: Fewer brackets than chord attacks is allowed
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 - 4 -" and lyrics "(啦) 啦啦"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has no error

  Scenario: More brackets than chord attacks is an error
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 - 4 -" and lyrics "(a) (b) (c)"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has an error

  Scenario: Several syllables in one bracket is an error
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 - - -" and lyrics "（陪我）"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has an error

  Scenario: An unbracketed first syllable takes a beat-1 chord attack
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "6 - 5 -" and lyrics "天 空 (好) 藍"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has no error
    And the chord "6" is drawn above the lyric "天"
    And the chord "5" is drawn above the bracket "(好)"

  Scenario: An unbracketed first syllable on beat 1 counts toward the chord attacks
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 - - -" and lyrics "啦 (啦)"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has an error

  Scenario: A chord rest does not count as an attack
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 0 4 -" and lyrics "(a) (b) (c)"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has an error

  Scenario: Two brackets match two attacks around a chord rest
    Given a chord-lyrics score with chords "1 0 4 -" and lyrics "(a) (b)"
    When the chord-lyrics score is rendered
    Then the chord-lyrics score has no error
