// Shared account sign-in + cloud-file-seeding `Given` steps, used as the
// `Background` for `account-sign-in.feature`, `files-cloud-backend.feature`,
// `cloud-backend-conflict-resolution.feature`, and every `-cloud`
// transposition of a deleted `-github` feature file. Kept in its own file
// (rather than folded into e.g. `files-cloud-backend.steps.ts`) since it's
// shared across so many feature files -- mirrors this project's existing
// convention of a dedicated steps file per reusable concern (compare
// `synced-share-button.steps.ts`'s "the owner is signed in as
// {string}").
//
// Module-level, not a fixture -- matches every other `.steps.ts` file's
// established pattern (e.g. `lastSignInPopup` in
// `synced-share-sign-in.steps.ts`). Tracks whichever email the
// current scenario's "an account is signed in as ..." step used, so a
// later "... is seeded for the signed-in account" step in the same
// scenario seeds under the same account without every feature file having
// to repeat the email in both steps.

// run, not a fresh in-memory mock scoped to one scenario like the deleted
// GitHub backend's tests had -- by the time a scenario's own "the active
// file" step runs, the account can already hold many *other* scenarios'
// files too (concurrent workers, or leftover rows from earlier runs), so
// grabbing "the first tab in the list" can no longer be assumed to mean
// "the file this scenario just seeded". Steps that need to act on "the
// file I just seeded" (rename/delete/duplicate in
// `files-cloud-backend.steps.ts`) select it by this exact tracked name
// instead.
