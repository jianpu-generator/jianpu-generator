/**
 * Regression fixture for the cross-part `Note ↔ Note` click-and-click
 * range gesture when both clicks land in the *same* measure (see
 * `cross_part` in `crates/jianpu-wasm/src/selection_range/note_note.rs`):
 * ranging by `measure_index` alone made two same-measure clicks on
 * different parts select the whole measure on both sides regardless of
 * where in the measure either click landed. Fixed by adding a second axis,
 * each note's own position within its `(part, measure)` group
 * (`note_position_in_measure`), so the range stops at that position on
 * both sides instead of sweeping the full measure.
 *
 * Two parts, three notes each, all in measure 0 — anchoring on Melody's
 * first note (index 0, position 0) and committing on Harmony's second note
 * (index 4, position 1) should select positions 0-1 in both parts (indices
 * 0, 1, 3, 4), leaving each part's third note (indices 2, 5) unselected.
