/**
 * Regression fixture for a bug introduced by the `note_position_in_measure`
 * axis added to the cross-part `Note ↔ Note` arm (see `cross_part` in
 * `crates/jianpu-wasm/src/selection_range/note_note.rs`): that axis's
 * `[position_start, position_end]` bound was applied to *every* measure in
 * the swept range uniformly, not just the boundary measures. So when the
 * anchor and current land in *different* measures, a rest ahead of the
 * later click's note (which pushes that note's own position further into
 * its measure) wrongly truncated the *earlier* measure too, even though
 * the earlier measure should be selected in full — same-line-selection
 * semantics, where an interior/earlier line is taken whole and only the
 * boundary line nearest the far click is partial.
 *
 * Two parts, two measures. Measure 0: each part's first note (position 0)
 * is a real note, followed by three rests (positions 1-3) — a whole
 * measure. Measure 1: each part opens with a rest (position 0), then a
 * real note (position 1), then two more rests (positions 2-3) — so the
 * "position" axis no longer lines up with "the first real note" once
 * rests are involved.
 *
 * Anchoring on Melody's measure-0 note (index 0, position 0) and
 * committing on Harmony's measure-1 note (index 13, position 1) must
 * select measure 0 in full (indices 0-7, all four positions of both
 * parts) and only positions 0-1 of measure 1 (indices 8, 9, 12, 13),
 * leaving measure 1's positions 2-3 (indices 10, 11, 14, 15) unselected.
