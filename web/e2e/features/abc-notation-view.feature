Feature: ABC notation view

  Background:
    Given a score in D major is loaded for the ABC notation view

  Scenario: Switching the preview to ABC replaces degree numbers with letter names
    Then the preview's note heads read "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1"
    And the preview's chord symbols read "1 6m/3 4△⁷ ♭5"
    When I switch the preview notation to "abc"
    Then the preview's note heads read "D E F♯ G A B C♯ D"
    And the preview's chord symbols read "D Bm/F♯ G△⁷ A♭"
    When I switch the preview notation to "jianpu"
    Then the preview's note heads read "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1"
    And the preview's chord symbols read "1 6m/3 4△⁷ ♭5"

  Scenario: The ABC view is remembered after a reload
    When I switch the preview notation to "abc"
    And I reload the page
    Then the preview's note heads read "D E F♯ G A B C♯ D"

  Scenario: Exporting a PDF from the ABC view writes letter names
    When I export "PDF" from the preview, keeping it as the jianpu PDF
    And I switch the preview notation to "abc"
    And I export "PDF" from the preview, keeping it as the abc PDF
    Then the abc PDF differs from the jianpu PDF
