Feature: Show the selected note/chord's letter names in a bottom drawer

  # When a click-and-click selection in the preview settles on exactly one
  # note (notes part) or one chord (chords part), a drawer slides up from the
  # bottom of the preview showing what that jianpu symbol means in letter
  # names, resolved against the key in effect at that measure. Chords also
  # get a guitar chord diagram.
