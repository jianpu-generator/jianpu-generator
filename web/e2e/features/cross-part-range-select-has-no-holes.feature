Feature: Cross-part click-and-click selection is always contiguous

  # A cross-part range covers the time between its two endpoints in every
  # row between them (see `cross_row_range` in
  # `crates/poentaro-wasm/src/selection_range/helpers.rs`). It used to bound
  # each part by the clicked note's position within its measure, so a part
  # with a different rhythm was left with a hole.

  Scenario: A held note in a middle part is selected when the range passes over it
    Given the score:
      """
      # parts
      A [A] = notes
      B [B] = notes
      C [C] = notes

      # score
      [A] 1 2 3 4
      [B] 5---
