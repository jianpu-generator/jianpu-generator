    When the file tree app loads
    And I open the file tree list
    And I choose "New file here" from the actions menu of the folder "Hymns"
    And I name the new file "untitled"
    Then the file switcher toolbar button shows the folder prefix "Hymns /" and the file name "untitled"

    Then the file tree shows the folder "Psalms" nested 2 levels deep
    And the file tree shows the empty folder hint

  Scenario: Import here puts the recovered file inside that folder
    When the file tree app loads
    And I export the active file as a PDF

    When the file tree app loads
    And I open the file tree list
