Feature: Part focus editor

  # Edits one part of the `# score` as a single stream, one measure per line,
  # in place of the main editor. Every other part shows as read-only ghost
  # lines around each measure, and the stream is re-barred as you type.

  Background:
    Given the part stream editor fixture is loaded

  Scenario: Choosing a part replaces the editor with that part's stream
    When I choose part "M" from the Edit part as stream menu
    Then the part focus editor is shown in place of the main editor
    And the part focus header says "Editing Melody [M]"
    And the part focus stream is:
      """

      5 6 7 1
      3 4 5 6
      """

  Scenario: Other parts appear as read-only ghost lines and labels as header rows
    When I choose part "M" from the Edit part as stream menu

    And measure 2 shows the header row "Chorus"
    And measure 3 shows the header row "3"
    And measure 1 shows the ghost lines below "[W] a b c d" and "[B] 1, - 5, -"
    And measure 3 shows no ghost line for part "B"
    And the ghost lines cannot be selected or edited

  Scenario: Hiding a part removes its ghost lines
    When I choose part "M" from the Edit part as stream menu
    And I hide part "B" with its toggle
