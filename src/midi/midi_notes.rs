/// Converts a duration in quarter-beats (sixteenth-note units) to MIDI ticks.

/// `quarter_beats` is read directly off a `GroupedNote`/`GroupedRest`/etc., which for a
/// tuplet-rescaled measure has already been multiplied by that measure's
/// `resolution_multiplier` (see `GroupedMeasure::resolution_multiplier`) — `multiplier`
/// divides that scaling back out so a tuplet note converts to the same tick count as the
/// equivalent plain note. `multiplier` is `1` for every non-tuplet measure, making this a
/// no-op division.
///
/// Known limitation: `TPQ` (480) only divides evenly by multipliers built from small prime
/// factors (2, 3, 5); a multiplier that pulls in a larger prime (e.g. `7` for a septuplet)
/// doesn't divide `quarter_beats * TPQ` evenly, so the result rounds down to the nearest
/// tick. This is accepted rounding error, not bumped away by raising `TPQ` — see the
/// **Tuplet** glossary entry in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
