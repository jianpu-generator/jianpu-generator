//! *run* of rests rather than a single written one: a collapsed
//! `MultiMeasureRest` bar, and a consolidated `implicit_fill` whole-rest

/// against the enclosing measure dividers. `layout_spacing::multi_measure_rest_weight`

/// written rest) puts it at the center of the whole measure, matching the
/// conventional Western whole-rest engraving, regardless of how many beats
/// the run collapsed. Slightly off (by half a column) at a system's very
/// first or last measure, whose opening/closing bar line is `Start`/`End`
/// aligned instead of `Center` — not worth threading that distinction
/// through just for this cosmetic centering.
