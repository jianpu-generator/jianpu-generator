//! Part stream editing: edit **one part** of the `# score` as a single
//! continuous stream of musical elements (no measure groups, no barlines, no
//! directives), then apply it back into the measure-grouped source.
//!
//! - [`extract_part_stream`] turns the part's per-measure lines into one
//!   stream of **measure chunks** (implicit trailing padding materialized as
//!   explicit `-`, unwritten measures shown as rests, as `@` for a follow
//!   part, or as `_` for a lyric part).
//! - [`apply_part_stream`] re-bars an edited stream by each measure's beat
//!   capacity (a lyric stream: by its target's lyric slots) and rewrites only
//!   the measures whose chunk changed; every other line (other parts,
//!   directives, comments) stays byte-for-byte.
//! - [`list_streamable_parts`] lists every declared part with the reason it
//!   can't be stream-edited, if any.
