// ── Span-aware column spring weight ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `measure_column_sizes` now splits an element's *weight* (spring) across
// every raw grid column any row actually anchors content to within that
// element's own span, while its *rod* stays concentrated entirely on its own
// start column (see **Rod and spring** in `ARCHITECTURE.md`). These tests
// exercise that split directly, distinct from `tests_column_rod_spring.rs`'s
// rod-floor invariants and `tests_measure_spacing.rs`'s span-1 proportional
// invariants (both of which stay numerically unaffected by this change).
