//! Verifies that a system's part-abbreviation label gets cleared when the
//! system boils down to a single row and that row is entirely rest — see
//! `layout_systems::clear_label_if_lone_resting_row`. A label only earns its
//! keep by distinguishing one row from another; a lone all-rest row has
//! nothing else in its system to distinguish itself from.
