# Syntax documentation

The `.jianpu` input syntax is documented in `syntax.md`.

- When a commit introduces or changes user-facing `.jianpu` syntax, **MUST update `syntax.md`** in the same commit.
- Syntax-affecting code lives under `src/parser/` and `src/desugar.rs`.


## Coding style
Prefer functional programming style and use the `itertools` library, unless the iterative version is simpler, shorter and easier to understand.


## How to generate the SVG?
Example:
```sh
cargo run -- generate svg simple.jianpu
```

Avoid using abbreviations when naming.

Test cases should not be inlined with the source code, they should live in separate files.

Never use tuple in new data structures, always use struct instead.

## Architecture documentation

The rendering pipeline layers, entry points, key types, and domain glossary are documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- When a layer's entry function signature or module path changes, **MUST update `ARCHITECTURE.md`** in the same commit.
- When a key type is added, removed, or renamed in any layer, **MUST update `ARCHITECTURE.md`** in the same commit.
- When a new domain term is introduced or an existing term is redefined, **MUST update the glossary in `ARCHITECTURE.md`** in the same commit.
