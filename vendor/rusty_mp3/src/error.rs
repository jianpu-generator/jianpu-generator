//! Dependency-free error type for the MP3 codec.
//!
//! The [`Error::Again`] / [`Error::Eof`] pair mirrors FFmpeg's
//! `EAGAIN`/`EOF` codec-drain protocol: a pull call ([`crate::Mp3Decoder::next_frame`],
//! [`crate::Mp3Encoder::next_packet`]) returns `Err(Again)` when more input is
//! needed before output can be produced, and `Err(Eof)` once the stream has been
//! flushed ([`crate::Mp3Decoder::flush`] / [`crate::Mp3Encoder::finish`]) and
//! fully drained. Neither is a failure — they drive the push/pull loop.
