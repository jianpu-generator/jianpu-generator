//! Mid/side joint-stereo encoding (the **R1+** enhancement) — the forward of
//! `decode/stereo.rs`.
//!
//! The decoder rotates `(M, S) → (L, R)` by `1/√2` in the frequency domain after
//! requantization. Because the analysis filterbank and MDCT are linear, doing the
//! same rotation in the **PCM domain** before analysis is exactly equivalent and
//! far simpler: store `M = (L+R)/√2`, `S = (L−R)/√2` and the decoder's inverse
//! reconstructs `L`/`R` to the bit. It is chosen per frame, only when the channels
//! are correlated enough that the side channel codes cheaply.
