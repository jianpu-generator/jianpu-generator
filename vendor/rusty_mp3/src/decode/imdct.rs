//! Hybrid synthesis stage 1: the inverse MDCT with windowing and overlap-add.
//!
//! Per subband (32), the 18 frequency lines run through an IMDCT — one 36-point
//! transform for long/start/stop blocks, or three 12-point transforms for short
//! blocks — then the matching window (Long/Start/Short/Stop). The first 18
//! samples overlap-add the previous granule's stored tail; the second 18 become
//! the next overlap. Odd subbands then get frequency inversion (every odd time
//! sample negated) to align with the synthesis filterbank.
