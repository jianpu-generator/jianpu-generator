Feature: A key change before the first `# sequence`-listed section survives into exported audio

  A measure's `key=` directive changes what pitch each scale degree (`1`-`7`)
  resolves to for every later measure, until the next `key=` directive. When a
  `# sequence` section is present, playback (and therefore MIDI/WAV/MP3 export)
  follows the sequence's resolved order instead of written order — but any
  measure written before the sequence's first listed section (e.g. an
  unlabeled intro, or one under a label the sequence never lists) never
  appears in that resolved order. Its `key=` directive should still carry
  forward as context for the measures that ARE played, the same way BPM/key
  context is accumulated for a measure-range selection.

  Scenario: A key set before the first sequence-listed section is not dropped from exported audio
    Given the score source:
      """
      # metadata
      title = "t"

      # parts
      Melody [M] = notes

      # sequence
      A

      # score
      key=F4
      [M] 1

      label="A"
      [M] 1
      """
    When the score's audio is generated
    Then the first sounded note is MIDI pitch 65
