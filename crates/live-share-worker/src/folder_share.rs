//! Pure, D1-free logic for sharing a whole folder. A folder share (see
//! `live-share-worker/migrations/0005_folder_shares.sql`) names a folder by
//! its path prefix, not by file ids: the viewer reads every active file whose
//! name starts with `<prefix>/` at that moment, so files added, edited,
//! renamed, moved in or out and deleted show up on the viewer's next load.
//! What lives here: validating the folder path, the size limits, building the
//! viewer's tree, and deciding which folder shares a batch rename moves.
