//! Wire types for the Synced Share worker's HTTP API. These are the single
//! source of truth: `ToSchema`/`IntoParams` put them in the OpenAPI spec
//! (`crate::openapi_json`) that `web`'s `build:worker-types` script turns
//! into `web/src/generated/live-share-worker/schema.ts` and its typed
//! client -- never hand-mirror them in TS.
//!
//! JSON field names use `camelCase` on the wire (matching the old TS
//! convention, e.g. `identityToken`), even though Rust field names stay
//! `snake_case`.

/// `shares` row keeps existing either way so a later start reproduces the

/// exception: `user_identities.login` (a cached, public GitHub display
/// name, not an internal id) is exposed here specifically so the
/// viewer-facing `SyncedShareBanner` can show "Shared by @login"; it's
