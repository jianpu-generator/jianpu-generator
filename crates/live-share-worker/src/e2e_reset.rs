//! The test-only `POST /e2e/reset` route's configuration (the route itself
//! is `crate::handlers::e2e_reset`). Local e2e runs reuse one Miniflare D1
//! state dir across invocations, so rows the synthetic e2e accounts create
//! pile up between runs -- e.g. every run reserves one more "source N"
//! default name -- and this route deletes those accounts outright before
//! each run (`web/e2e/global-setup.ts`), and before scenarios that need an
//! account in a known state (a fresh sign-up, a lockout).
//!
//! Gated on `EMAILS_VAR`: the route is only registered into the router when
//! that var is set, so without it the worker answers `/e2e/reset` exactly as
//! it does any unknown path. The real `cloudflare.config.ts` never sets it;
//! only e2e's local `cf dev` passes it (see `web/playwright.config.ts`). Its
//! value is also the allowlist: a JSON array of the emails whose accounts
//! the route may delete, so the route can never touch any other account.
//!
//! D1-free, so `tests/e2e_reset.rs` can test the parsing directly.
