//! The one error body every route answers a failure with. A tagged union
//! (`code`) rather than ad-hoc status/body pairs, so the web client's
//! generated types (see `crate::handlers::routes`) let it `switch` on
//! `code` exhaustively instead of re-matching raw HTTP statuses or
//! hand-typed `{code: "..."}` literals. The HTTP status is derived from the
//! variant (`status_code`), never chosen separately at a call site.
//!
//! On the wire every failure is an `ApiErrorBody`: the `ApiError` plus the
//! request's trace ID, which the web app shows and `app_log` is keyed by.
