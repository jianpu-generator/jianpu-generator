//! Pure, D1-free view logic for a Synced Share. A share (see
//! `live-share-worker/migrations/0004_shares_reference_files.sql`) is a
//! pointer to a cloud `files` row, not a copy of its content: the viewer
//! reads the file itself, so the only write path is the owner's ordinary
//! autosave (`POST /files/:id/content`). Ownership is enforced by the
//! owner-scoped SQL in `queries/`, the same way the `/files/*` routes work,
//! so nothing here needs to compare identities.
