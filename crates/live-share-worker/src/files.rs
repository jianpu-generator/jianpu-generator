//! Pure, D1-free logic for the cloud (D1) storage backend's `files` table --
//! the replacement for the old GitHub Contents API storage backend, unified
//! under the same account identity `crate::identity` already resolves for
//! Synced Share. See `live-share-worker/migrations/0003_files.sql` for the
//! schema this mirrors.
//!
//! There is no single "apply a write" entry point --
//! `crate::handlers`'s `/files/*` routes each perform their own atomic D1
//! `UPDATE`/`INSERT` (see `crate::db`), because rename/delete/restore are
//! unconditional (no revision gate, per the old GitHub backend's actual
//! behavior) while a content save is gated on `expected_revision` as an
//! optimistic-concurrency guard. What stays pure and unit-testable here is
//! *classifying* the outcome of a content-save attempt -- the one op with
//! real conflict semantics to get right.
