//! Typed events for the `app_log` table (migrations `0006_app_log.sql` and
//! `0009_app_log_trace_id.sql`): an
//! append-only log in D1 that agents and the owner query with SQL (the saved
//! queries in `queries/observability/`) so production behaviour, e.g. why a
//! user got signed out, can be explained from data instead of guessed.
//!
//! The table is generic (a `flow` column, not a table per flow) and only sees
//! text; the type safety lives here. `LogEvent` is the only way to describe a
//! row: `LogEvent::to_row` splits it into the `flow`/`kind`/`outcome`/
//! `subject`/`detail` columns, deriving `outcome` and `subject` from the
//! variant so they can never contradict it.
//!
//! D1/JsValue-free and `pub` so `tests/app_log.rs` can unit-test it; the D1
//! writes live in the crate-private `db::app_log`.
